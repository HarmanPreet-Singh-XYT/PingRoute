**PingRoute** is a powerful network diagnostic tool designed to help users analyze network performance and troubleshoot connectivity issues. The application performs traceroute to an IP address, pings each hop along the route, and provides detailed statistics including minimum, maximum, average, and last ping times. It visualizes key network metrics such as packet loss, latency, jitter, and average latency through interactive graphs and charts.

This tool is ideal for network administrators, IT professionals, and anyone needing in-depth network performance analysis.

## Features

- **Traceroute Analysis**: Perform traceroute to any IP address and visualize the path packets take across the network.
- **Ping Statistics**: Retrieve detailed statistics for each hop, including minimum, maximum, average, and last ping times.
- **Visualized Metrics**: Graphically display key network parameters like packet loss, latency, jitter, and average latency.
- **Domain Name Resolution**: View the domain names of each hop for clearer identification of network nodes.
- **Local Data Processing**: All data processing is done locally on your device; no personal or network data is transmitted or logged.
- **Customizable Intervals**: Configure the ping interval and graph update interval according to your needs.
